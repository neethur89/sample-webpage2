      <h3>Instructions</h3>
      <p>In a small bowl, mix together the italian seasoning, paprika, salt & pepper. Pat the chicken dry and then rub
        both sides with the seasoning mixture.
        1 tbsp italian seasoning,½ tsp paprika,salt & pepper,1 lb boneless, skinless chicken breast</p>
      <p>Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook for 5-7 minutes on each side
        until golden brown and cooked through. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside.</p>
      <p>Reduce heat to medium-low and add more avocado oil and butter. Then, add onion and season it with salt. Cook,
        stirring occasionally, for about 3 minutes, or until beginning to get tender and translucent. Add garlic, stir,
        and cook for 1 minute longer.
        1 tbsp avocado oil,1 tbsp unsalted butter,½ jumbo yellow onion,4-6 large cloves garlic</p>
      <p>Deglaze the pan with chicken broth, scraping up all the browned bits stuck to the bottom. Allow the broth to
        come to a light boil. Then, add the dry pasta and stir to make sure that the pasta is submerged in the broth.
        2 cups chicken broth,8 oz dry penne pasta
        Cover the pan and cook for 10 minutes or until the pasta is al-dente.</p>
      <p>Turn off the heat and add in the parmesan, heavy cream and parsley. Stir until the parmesan is melted and the
        sauce is warm and thickened slightly. Taste and adjust salt and pepper as needed.
        1 cup finely grated parmesan cheese,½ cup heavy cream,2 tbsp chopped parsley
        Slice the cooked chicken into strips and add it into the pan along with the pasta. Toss to combine. Then, serve
